Articulatory feature extraction for training neural networks

1. Download the af_feat directory in preferably the $FESTVOXDIR/src/ dir as af_feat
2. mkdir cmu_us_rms
3. $FESTVOXDIR/src/af_feat/setup_AF_extract
4. copy wav and text
5. ./bin/dump_AF_world_feats UTT/FRAME depending on if you want framewise or uttwise

Acoustic WORLD feats saved in binary_af_feats as .cmp files dim 199
Articulator features saved in binary_af_feats as .af for UTT and .faf for framewise dim 77 see featnames for description of features
